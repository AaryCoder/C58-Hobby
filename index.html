            <h2> I love to play video games on my Nintendo switch and Computer! I also love to code. Go to the "coding Projects" tab to see all my projects. </h2>

            <p> My name is Aaryan Fazal and I love to play games on my computer. This is because it is a way for me to entertain myself and have fun. I can also hang out with freinds by playing online games. What I mean is that if I am bored or my freind is bored and we can't meet up or anything, we can play video games together! I also love to code because when I code, I feel a bond with it! I also think that in the future, coding can really help people and can save lives sometimes, too. </p>
